# Similar Image Retrieval using Distance Measure
> This is a LAB work from Data Mining course of my 4th year in Khulna University. In this project, you need to store feature vector (distance measures) of training images in a database. Then, need to check similarity with a query image and display most similar 20 images in 3 rows. Query image needs to be displayed on 1st row 1st column.

> I did this in MATLAB using MATLAB GUIDE for GUI.
